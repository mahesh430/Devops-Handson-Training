#### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "namespace": "MyCustomNamespace",
    "metrics_collected": {
      "mem": {
        "measurement": [
          "mem_used_percent"
        ]
      },
      "disk": {
        "measurement": [
          "used_percent"
        ],
        "resources": [
