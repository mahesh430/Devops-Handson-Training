# OSI Model: From Application Layer to Physical Layer

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network communications between different systems. It divides the communication process into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions.

## Application Layer (Layer 7)

- **Function**: Provides network services to end-user applications.
- **Data**: User data is created here. For example, when you send an email, the email content is created at this layer.
- **Transformation**: Data remains in its original form (e.g., an email text).

## Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

- **Function**: Translates, encrypts, and compresses data.
- **Data**: The email content is translated into a format that can be understood by the receiving system. It might also be encrypted for security and compressed to reduce size.
- **Transformation**: Data is formatted, encrypted, and compressed (e.g., converting text to a standardized format, applying encryption, and compression algorithms).

## Session Layer (Layer 5)

- **Function**: Manages sessions between applications.
- **Data**: Session information (like synchronization points and checkpoints) is added to ensure that the email can be reassembled correctly at the receiver's end.
- **Transformation**: Data now includes session-related information (e.g., session initiation and termination).

## Transport Layer (Layer 4)

- **Function**: Provides reliable data transfer and error recovery.
- **Data**: The email content is divided into smaller segments. Each segment is given a sequence number for reassembly and error-checking data.
- **Transformation**: Data is segmented, and headers with sequence and error-checking information are added.

## Network Layer (Layer 3)

- **Function**: Handles logical addressing and routing.
- **Data**: Each segment from the transport layer is encapsulated into packets. Logical addresses (IP addresses) are added to these packets to determine the path across the network.
- **Transformation**: Data is now in the form of packets, with IP addresses and routing information added.

## Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

- **Function**: Provides node-to-node data transfer and error detection.
- **Data**: Each packet is encapsulated into frames. Physical addresses (MAC addresses) are added to the frames to ensure that data reaches the correct physical device.
- **Transformation**: Data is framed, with MAC addresses and error-checking codes added.

## Physical Layer (Layer 1)

- **Function**: Transmits raw bit streams over a physical medium.
- **Data**: Frames are converted into electrical, optical, or radio signals depending on the transmission medium (e.g., cables, fiber optics, wireless).
- **Transformation**: Data is transformed into signals that can travel over the physical medium (e.g., electrical pulses, light waves, radio waves).

At the receiving end, the process is reversed, with each layer stripping away its corresponding headers and trailers, eventually delivering the original user data to the application layer.
