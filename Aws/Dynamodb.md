# AWS DynamoDB Documentation

## Overview

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB enables you to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.

## Why Use AWS DynamoDB?

### Benefits of Using Amazon DynamoDB

1. **Fully Managed**:
   - DynamoDB is a fully managed database service, which means AWS takes care of administrative tasks such as backups, patching, and scaling.

2. **Performance**:
   - DynamoDB provides fast, predictable performance with single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.

3. **Scalability**:
   - DynamoDB can automatically scale up and down to adjust for capacity and maintain performance as your application grows.

4. **Durability and Availability**:
   - DynamoDB is designed to be highly available and durable, with data automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region.

5. **Security**:
   - DynamoDB integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provide fine-grained access control and with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption at rest.

6. **Flexible Data Model**:
   - DynamoDB's flexible schema allows you to create tables without defining the structure of the data in advance, providing more flexibility in how you store and manage your data.

### When to Use Amazon DynamoDB

1. **High Throughput and Low Latency**:
   - When you need a database that can handle high request rates and low latency.

2. **Scalability**:
   - When you anticipate significant growth in the size of your dataset or the volume of your database queries.

3. **Flexible Schema Requirements**:
   - When you need a database that does not enforce a rigid schema, allowing you to store different types of data within the same table.

4. **Serverless Applications**:
   - When building serverless applications that require a highly available and scalable database.

5. **Event-Driven Architectures**:
   - When you need a database that integrates well with AWS services like Lambda, SNS, and SQS for event-driven architectures.

## Key Features

### On-Demand and Provisioned Capacity Modes

- **On-Demand Mode**:
  - Pay for the read and write requests you make to your tables.
  - Ideal for unpredictable workloads.

- **Provisioned Mode**:
  - Specify the number of reads and writes per second that you require.
  - Ideal for predictable workloads.

### Global Tables

- Enable multi-region, fully replicated tables to provide low-latency access to data globally.

### Streams

- DynamoDB Streams capture data modification events in DynamoDB tables, which can be processed by AWS Lambda or other AWS services.

### Transactions

- Support for ACID transactions, allowing you to perform multiple operations on one or more tables atomically.

## Getting Started with Amazon DynamoDB

### Step 1: Create a DynamoDB Table

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**.
2. **Navigate to the DynamoDB Console**.
3. **Click on "Create Table"**.
4. **Specify the table name and primary key**.
   - Table Name: `ExampleTable`
   - Primary Key: `ID` (String)
5. **Configure settings** (leave default settings for this example).
6. **Click on "Create"**.

### Step 2: Insert Data into the Table

1. **In the DynamoDB Console**, navigate to the `ExampleTable`.
2. **Click on the "Items" tab**.
3. **Click on "Create Item"**.
4. **Enter the primary key and other attributes**.
   - `ID`: `1`
   - `Name`: `John Doe`
   - `Age`: `30`
5. **Click on "Save"**.
6. **Repeat steps 3-5** to add more items.

### Step 3: Query the Table

1. **In the DynamoDB Console**, navigate to the `ExampleTable`.
2. **Click on the "Items" tab**.
3. **Click on "Scan"** to view all items in the table.
4. **To query by primary key**, click on "Query" and enter the primary key value.

### Example: Creating a DynamoDB Table Using AWS CLI

```sh
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name ExampleTable \
    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=ID,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=ID,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5
```

### Example: Inserting an Item Using AWS CLI

```sh
aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name ExampleTable \
    --item '{"ID": {"S": "1"}, "Name": {"S": "John Doe"}, "Age": {"N": "30"}}'
```

### Example: Querying Items Using AWS CLI

```sh
aws dynamodb query \
    --table-name ExampleTable \
    --key-condition-expression "ID = :id" \
    --expression-attribute-values '{":id":{"S":"1"}}'
```
